											<p style="font-size:18px;">Quasi-experimental designs for learning systems</p>
										</header>

										<p style="font-size:18px;">Causal Question</p>
										<p style="font-size:14px;">Consider a hospital where data was collected to build a risk prediction model of whether a patient would have a certain adverse outcome after leaving the hospital. A patient is flagged when the model predicts that they are at risk. Physicians can see this flag and intervene on these flagged patients. While risk prediction models support clinical decision making, the emergence of learning health systems comes with new challenges. A learning system is a system that continually collects data, learns from the data, and adapts the system according to what is learned. There is a need to evaluate how using acquired knowledge to continuously adapt a learning health system could ultimately affect or improve a patient’s outcome. Figure 1 highlights areas within the learning health system where continuous learning and adapting takes place, which need to be accounted for when evaluating the effect of an intervention. </p>

										<figure>

											<figcaption>Fig.1 Areas where learning and adapting takes place within a learning health system.</figcaption>
										</figure>
										<br>
										
										<p style="font-size:14px;">First, we want to be able to learn from the data and adapt our system with acquired knowledge. As more data is available, there is a growing interest in how to best use and manage data to help inform clinical decision making within a healthcare system$^1$. The collection and assembly of observational data that accurately portrays what is happening within the system is the result of a knowledge-generating process that includes clinicians’ judgement and expertise. More specifically, data should reflect changes in clinical practice overtime and be representative of the population targeted by the outcome prediction model$^2$. </p>
										<p style="font-size:14px;">Second, we want data collected while the prediction model is being evaluated to immediately inform how the outcome prediction model should be updated and used in the future. This learning stage includes the development, calibration, and validation of the model by making use of the data collected to better target those at high risk. Issues such as candidate predictors, sample size, missing data, statistical technique, and overfitting require special consideration at this stage$^3$. Other aspects of the prediction model such as missingness and fairness, which are known sources of bias, may need to be assessed and adapted as more data is collected$^{4,5}$. Adapting the outcome prediction model may lead to improved prediction accuracy, generalizability, and equity.</p>
										<p style="font-size:14px;">Third, we want to allow the system to learn in terms of the recommended treatment while accounting for a given set of dynamic constraints. For instance, the threshold for the risk model-based recommendation could change. Choosing this risk cutoff value is not always straightforward and has several tradeoffs. Changes to this threshold influence two main components: the average treatment effect and the number of patients intervened. Small sample sizes could be problematic when estimating the treatment effect which might lead to changes in threshold to obtain greater statistical precision. Moreover, intervening on a small number of patients may significantly reduce the number of patients that may have benefited from the risk-reduction strategy$^6$. On the other hand, from a clinician’s perspective the threshold might need to be updated due to capacity constraints such as a limit in the number of patients that can be intervened, as large sample sizes could generate time and resource burden. Moreover, intervening on many patients could be inefficient if low risk patients are receiving little to no benefit from the intervention. </p>
										<p style="font-size:14px;">Fourth, given that physicians are in the loop of making interventions on flagged patients, we want to learn and adapt our system with regard to physician expertise, as well as observed outcomes. Disparities between physicians and the outcome prediction model can diminish the value of risk prediction tools by reducing physician compliance in the recommended treatment$^7$. Incorporating expert feedback in a learning system has been shown to be a valuable way of eliminating algorithmic errors to improve accuracy of predictions that align with a physician’s decision-making process$^8$. While learning systems may help facilitate the identification of high-risk patients, human compliance with an algorithm recommendation has been shown to introduce both automation bias and algorithm aversion into the system$^{7,8}$. Automation bias refers to the overreliance of a human to an algorithm decision and algorithm aversion refers to underreliance of algorithmic recommendations. One way to mitigate a physician’s overreliance or underreliance to decision support is improving the face validity of an outcome prediction model’s recommended treatment. Studies have shown that interpretability of results is directly associated with a human’s perceived accuracy of the model$^9$. This emphasizes the need for learning and adapting using a human understandable rationale.</p>
										<p style="font-size:14px;">As of now, most of the works on learning health systems focus on developing robust frameworks of risk prediction models without accounting for the effect of intervening on a patient using these continually assessed and updating algorithms. Improving the risk prediction model will not necessarily make the intervention more successful. There could be many reasons why an intervention does not work. Failed interventions may be due to program design or difficulties with program implementation, competing organizational priorities, staff reluctance to an intervention, and resource constraints$^{10}$. However, a learning health system can help inform clinicians with actionable knowledge that could enable improvements to interventions, such as priorities for resource allocation, that ultimately can improve patient outcomes and experience. </p>
										<p style="font-size:14px;"><b>Our goal is to measure the direct impact that intervening according to a risk prediction model has on a person's outcomes. </b> Therefore, we want to be able to perform causal inference from observational data$^{11}$. The reason we restrict to observational data is that it can be impractical to randomize a person to an intervention based on a risk prediction. Instead, systems are encouraged for financial or ethical reasons to provide the best option available based on current knowledge. Learning can violate a core assumption in the causal inference literature that each person does not interfere with each other$^{12}$. Existing methods are equipped to handle one of these goals but not the other. For example, quasi-experimental designs, such as regression discontinuity$^{10, 12-16}$ or difference-in-difference$^{17}$, allows one to perform causal inference from observational data, but are not equipped to account for learning. A solution to these problems requires a new approach.</p>

										<p style="font-size:18px;">Causal Framework</p>
										<p style="font-size:16px;">Variables</p>

										<p style="font-size:14px;">Let $i$ index a person in order of arrival to a learning system with $i=1,\ldots,n$. We define the following random variables: $X_i \in \mathcal{X}$ is a vector of patient characteristics (model input); $A_i \in \{0,1\}$ indicates assignment to intervention; and $Y_i$ is the outcome of interest that is observed. Specifically, patients characteristics $X_i$ for each patient $i$ is input into a risk prediction model $g_i:  \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ which results in predicted risk score $R_{i} := g_i(X_i)$. Then, $C_i$ is the risk cutoff that patient $i$ was subject to for assigning intervention. Patients with $R_{i} \geq C_i$ are assigned to the treatment condition, and patients with $R_{i} &lt; C_i$ are assigned to the control condition, leading to $A_{i}=I(R_{i}\geq C_i)$. We will also consider a window around the neighborhood of the cutoff $C_i$ is denoted by $W_i=[C_i - \underset{\bar{}}{r}, C_i + \bar{r}]$ on the support of the risk score $R_i$ and containing the cutoff $C_i$.</p>

										<p style="font-size:14px;">To summarize, consider the following random variables and functions:</p>

										<ul>
											<li>$X_i$ --- person characteristics (model input)</li>
											<li>$A_i$ --- binary assignment to intervention</li>
											<li>$Y_i$ --- outcome of interest</li>
											<li>$g_i$ --- risk prediction model (function)</li>
											<li>$R_i$ --- predicted risk (model output)</li>
											<li>$C_i$ --- risk cutoff for assigning intervention</li>
											<li>$W_i$ --- window around $C_i$</li>
										</ul>
										
										<p style="font-size:16px;">DAG</p>
										<p style="font-size:14px;"> Assume person $i$ is assigned to the intervention ($A_i = 1$) when the predicted risk $R_i$ exceeds $C_i$. Learning is captured by allowing the threshold $C_i$ and prediction algorithm $g_i$ to update according to the history $(X_h,A_h,Y_h)$ with $h &lt; i$. Consequently, $(X_i,A_i,Y_i)$ may not be iid. These assumptions are captured by the directed acyclic graph (DAG) in Figure 2 when $i = 2$. </p>

										<figure>
											<img src="images/Slide1.png"  >
											<figcaption>Fig.2 DAG when $i=2$.</figcaption>
										</figure>

										<br>
										  
										<p style="font-size:14px;"> Making the structural causal model (SCM) in Figure 2 precise, the parent of $R_1$ is $X_1$; the parents of $R_2$ are $X_1$, $A_1$, $Y_1$, and $X_2$; the parents of $A_1$ are $R_1$ and $C_1$; the parents of $A_2$ are $R_2$ and $C_2$; the parents of $C_2$ are $X_1$, $A_1$, and $Y_1$. Similarly, the parents of $Y_1$ are $X_1$ and $A_1$; the parents of $Y_2$ are $X_2$ and $A_2$.</p>
										<p style="font-size:14px;"> For simplicity our example has $i=2$, however this SCM could be generalized in the following way:</p>
										<p style="font-size:14px;"> <b>Assumption 1</b> (Structural causal model) We introduce a SCM $\mathfrak{C}:=(\textbf{S},\textbf{P}_{N}$) with a list $\textbf{S}$ of assignments</p>
										<p style="font-size:14px;">$X_i:=f_{X_i}(N_{X_i})$</p>
										<p style="font-size:14px;">$R_i:=f_{R_i}(\textbf{PA}_{R_i},N_{R_i})=g_i(X_i)$</p>
										<p style="font-size:14px;">$A_i:=f_{A_i}(\textbf{PA}_{A_i},N_{A_i})$</p>
										<p style="font-size:14px;">$C_i:=f_{C_i}(\textbf{PA}_{C_i},N_{C_i})$ </p>
										<p style="font-size:14px;">$ Y_i:=f_{Y_i}(\textbf{PA}_{Y_i},N_{Y_i})$</p>
										<p style="font-size:14px;">where $\textbf{PA}_{R_i}\subseteq\{\bar{X}_{i-1},\bar{A}_{i-1},\bar{Y}_{i-1},X_i\}\setminus \{R_i\}$ (using an overbar to denote history of the previous $i-1$ patients), $\textbf{PA}_{A_i}\subseteq\{R_i, C_i\}\setminus \{A_i\}$, $\textbf{PA}_{C_i}\subseteq\{\bar{X}_{i-1},\bar{A}_{i-1},\bar{Y}_{i-1}\}\setminus \{C_i\}$ and  $\textbf{PA}_{Y_i}\subseteq\{X_i, A_i\}\setminus \{Y_i\}$ are the parents of $R_i$, $A_i$, $C_i$ and $Y_i$, respectively; and a distribution of jointly independent noise variables $\textbf{P}_{N}={P}_{X_i, R_i, A_i, C_i, Y_i}$. Notice that $N_{R_i}$ has no effect given that $R_i$ is a deterministic function $g_i$ of $X_i$.</p>

										<p style="font-size:16px;">Average causal effect of the intervention</p>


										<p style="font-size:14px;">We rely on the potential outcomes framework to define what would happen if person $i$ were assigned to treatment. This forced assignment, denoted by $A_i=1$, can influence the outcome of patient $i$ and intervention assignment (<i>via</i> a change in the prediction model or risk cutoff $C_i$) of any successive person $i > j$. We introduce the potential outcome $Y_i(A_1,A_2,\ldots,A_{i-1},a_i)$ of any person $i$ if they were assigned to intervention $a_i$ and the previous $i-1$ patients were assigned their observed treatment. We can re-write this potential outcome concisely as $Y_i(\bar{A}_{i-1},a_i)$ using an overbar to denote treatment history of the previous $i-1$ patients: $\bar{A}_{i-1}=(A_1,A_2, \cdots, A_{i-1})$. We want to investigate estimators for average causal effects of the following form:</p>

										<p style="font-size:14px;"><b>Average Causal Effect 1.</b> Let $\beta_i(y)$ denote the conditional average treatment effect of the intervention for person $i$ with a predicted risk of $R_i$ from algorithm $g_i$:</p>
										<p style="font-size:14px;">$\beta_i(y) := E\left[ Y_{i}(\bar{A}_{i-1}, 1)-Y_{i}(\bar{A}_{i-1}, 0) \big| g_i(X_i) \in W_i \right]$</p>
										<p style="font-size:14px;">Specifically, the average causal effect for patient $i$, given that their predicted risk $R_i$ from algorithm $g_i$ is inside the window $W_i$, is the difference between the outcome that the patient would receive if assigned to the intervention and the outcome that same patient would receive if not assigned.</p>
